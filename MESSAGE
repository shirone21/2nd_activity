LSM to my self

I want to remind myself that I’m doing better than I give myself credit for. Even on days when I feel tired, unsure, or overwhelmed, I still show up. I still try. That matters.
The effort I put in, even when no one notices, still counts. I’ve survived moments I once thought would break me, and I’m still here, still learning, still growing.
I don’t need to have everything figured out to be proud of myself — progress isn’t always loud, and strength doesn’t always look perfect.

I’m learning to be gentler with myself. I’m allowed to rest without guilt, to move at my own pace, and to feel what I feel without judging it.
I don’t have to rush my healing or compare my journey to anyone else’s. Who I am right now is enough. The fact that I care deeply, that I try to be kind,
that I keep hoping even after disappointment — those are not weaknesses. They’re proof of my heart and my resilience.

I choose to believe that I am not behind and I am not failing — I am becoming. My story is still unfolding, and the chapters that feel confusing now will one day make sense.
I will keep trusting myself, even when it’s hard. I will keep choosing kindness, especially toward myself. I deserve love, patience, and grace just as much as anyone else.
I’m proud of how far I’ve come, and I’ll keep going.
